# Parish

This is a command line interface for scraping data from [this website](https://tprmb.ca/lto/jsp/documentSearchServices.jsp).

## Installation

1. Install the current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
1. Open your command line application (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux)
1. Run the following command

```bash
npm install -g parish
```

This will make the `parish` command available to you on your command line.

## Usage

Type `parish` at your command line and press enter to start the interactive prompts. The CSV file with the results will be saved in the current directory. If you don't know how to change to a different directory on your command line, try doing a YouTube search with the words _change directory PowerShell_ or _change directory terminal_. The first video will probably help.
